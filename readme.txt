<strong>Font Size</strong>

The first setting of the plugin is called 'Font Size' and features a draggable scale to increase or decrease the size of the font of accordions or faqs content. The exact number of size appears in the right field. If you delete the number from this field, the size of the font returns to the default setting of Accordions or FAQs. Font size option is for making the accordions font size within the content more accurate. What you need is just give the right size for the images of the accordions heading or content font size. Just change the value and make accurate with your Website.

<strong>Color</strong>

As fonts are so basic, we have placed them above all custom font settings. While creating an accordions or faqs you can choose any colors from the color picker, or enter the hex code of the color you want for the font. A best idea is to manipulate the color picker default colors in the main settings page of the plugin, so they will be simply accessible for you when customizing font and other element colors. 

<strong>Active Color</strong>

Active Color is the exceptional part of accordions where you can make more attractive of your website content to viewers. Its show you when any accordions are active or that’s accordions data are viewing. This tool will help you to engage more customers to your business.

<strong>Font Family</strong>

Developers are able to change the font family of the text element they are editing. They can type the font they’re looking for, or browse and choose a font, using the scrolling drop-down menu. Once you choose a font from the font family it will be displayed live on the editor, so you can play around the content and experiment what works best for your design. You can judge your work at the front of your eyes. Fonts we love and recommend using are Roboto, Proxima, Poppins, Vida Loca, Raleway, Playfare, Lobster, Abril Fatface and Pacifico. Every Google font is already included in Accordiona of FAQa, so you have hundreds of different options to choose.

<strong>Font Weight</strong>

This font weight option is an awesome part of CSS where you can make your FAQs more perfect with your website. By changing the value and show your data live with our awesome Accordions or FAQs wordpress plugin.
